# **Water Main Controller**
This project started as just a pressure sensor for my home plumbing and expanded to include a electric valve.  The valve was added after I realized I might be able to check for small leaks by performing a static pressure test by turning off the water coming into the house for a short time and watching for a pressure drop when water was not being used and when the hot water heater was not heating.

Of course, the valve can be used to turn off water if water leak sensors external to this project detect a leak as well.  Using external water leak sensors require a home automation system (I use Home Assistant) to be integrated with this project and the external sensors. 

MQTT is used as the integration interface to this project.  See additional comments below.
<br/><br/>
## **Pressure sensor**
If you need only valve control, the pressure sensor does not have to be installed. Just be sure to set the software accordingly either by setting the *#define INITIAL_PRESSURE_SENSOR_INSTALLED_STATE* directive in the code or during runtime using the *pressureInstalled* MQTT command.

The pressure sensor used is a M3200 series I2C interfaced model from TE Connectivity Industrial Pressure Sensors.  The specific model I used is M32JM-000105-100PG purchased from Mouser Electronics.  If you use this model be aware that external 4.7K pull up resistors are required for the SDA and SCL wires.

### **Pressure Sensor Default Programming**
Programming behavior can be changed by varying the *#define* directives in the program.  Here is the default behavior:
- Sensor is read every 500ms
- Under quiescent conditions, pressure is published every 5 minutes
- If there is a pressure change of more than 0.3 PSI, the current pressure is published every five seconds
- If the pressure sensor cannot be read a fault will be published every 5 minutes
<br/><br/>
## **Motorized Valve**
If you need only pressure sensing, the valve does not have to be installed.  Just be sure to set the software accordingly either by setting the *#define INITIAL_VALVE_INSTALLED_STATE* directive in the code or during runtime using the *valveInstalled* MQTT command.

The motorized valve used is a U.S. Solid model JFMSV00014 3/4" diameter Motorized Ball Valve (available on Amazon).  _Be sure you order the diameter approriate for your plumbing_.  

This model has five wires - two to control the valve (via polarity reversal) and three to connected to open/closed indicator switches.  There are other models from U.S. Solid that look the same but have different wire configurations.  The five-wire model is required if you wish to use this code without modification.
<br/><br/>
## **Software**
The Water Main Controller software is written using PlatformIO.  However, it can be compiled using Arduino IDE by simply copying the text in src/main.cpp to a Arduino sketch file (e.g watermain.ino) and compiling using the IDE.  You will need to add the libraries indicated in the code comments before compiling.

### **MQTT**
All reporting and interaction with The Water Main Montior is accomplished via MQTT.  If you've never heard of MQTT, there are many good tutorials on the web,  It is best to have a firm grasp on MQTT concepts before beginning this project.

Although there is robust logging available from the serial port, the primary interface for interaction and configuration is through MQTT reports and commands.  The documentation for commands are in the code and are purposely not duplicated here to avoid having to maintain documentation in multiple places.

Using a MQTT tool such as MQTT Explorer (http://mqtt-explorer.com/) is strongly recommended to fully understand, configure, test, and debug the project.

### **Static Pressure Test**
Both the pressure sensor and the valve must be installed to use this feature.  

A Static Pressure Test is used to check for small leaks by turning off the water coming into the house for a short time and watching for a pressure drop when water is not being used and the hot water heater is not heating.  Determining hot water heater activity requires an additional sensor that is outside the scope of this project.  Short of sensing hot water heater activity, simply pick a time for the test when the hot water heater activity is unlikely.

A Static Pressure Test is initiated by sending the *sptStartTest* MQTT command (read code comments for all commands) to the controller.  Once the command is received, the test begins immediately.  

Results are published via MQTT at the end of the test.  It is up to an external process to determine if the test passed, failed, or  invalid due to water use or hot water heater activity.  In my case the external process is done in Home Assistant.
- Default SPT duration is 10 minutes
- Pressure reporting frequency is set to every 30 seconds during SPT.  Reporting frequency is restored to pre-test frequency when the test concludes.
- Valve is closed at the start and restored to pre-test state at end of test
- Timestamp of start of test, test duration, beginning pressure, ending pressure, and the difference is published via MQTT at the *end* of the test


### **Home Assistant**
If you use Home Assistant, the following is the code required for your configuration.yaml.  This should make the entities *sensor.water_pressure, sensor.water_temperature, switch.water_valve, sensor.water_static_pressure_test* and *script.scr_spt_start* available for your use.
<br/><br/>

If you have installed the pressure sensor, add the following to enable sensors

```
sensor:
  - platform: mqtt
    unique_id: water_pressure
    name: "Water Pressure"
    state_topic: "watermain/water_pressure"
    qos: 0
    device_class: "pressure"
    unit_of_measurement: "PSI"
    
  - platform: mqtt
    unique_id: water_temperature
    name: "Water Temperature"
    state_topic: "watermain/water_temperature"
    qos: 0
    device_class: "temperature"
    unit_of_measurement: "ÂºF"
  ```

  If you have installed the valve, add the following for manual control
  
```
switch:
  - platform: mqtt
    name: "Water Valve"
    unique_id: water_valve
    state_topic: "watermain/valve_zeroisclosed"
    command_topic: "watermain/cmd/valveState"
    payload_on: "1"
    payload_off: "0"
    qos: 2
```

If you have both pressure sensor and valve installed, the add the following to enable SPT
```
sensor:
  - platform: mqtt
    unique_id: water_static_pressure_test
    name: "Water Static Pressure Test"
    state_topic: "watermain/spt_result"
    unit_of_measurement: "PSI"
    json_attributes_topic: "watermain/spt_result/attributes"

script:
  scr_manual_spt:
    sequence:
    - service: mqtt.publish
        data:
        topic: watermain/cmd/sptStart
```

The panel mount holes of the 3D printed enclosure accomodates the specific connectors listed below.  If you don't want to use these connectors, the 3D Fusion360 source file can be modified to suit whatever connectors you choose.

Note the aviation connectors below are specified with different number of pins to prevent accidentally interchanging the pressure sensor and the valve control wires.  It is possible to use the 6-pin version for both wires if you don't confuse the two or select pin connections so no harm is done if interchanged.

## **3D Printed Enclosure**
3D Printing files and the Fusion360 source file are available in this repository under the 3D_Printed_Enclosure directory.  I printed my enclosure using PETG to avoid potential shrinkage issues surrounding the snap-on lid, but there is nothing special about PETG otherwise.  Both STL and Fusion360 files are provided.  If you don't have a 3D printer, there are many services available online that will print for a fee.

You will need to print the bottom, the lid, and one of the two slide-in mounts depending on desired final orientation.

- The wiring diagram above shows the WeMos ESP8266 D1 Mini ESP8266 board right side up for clarity, but it is mounted upside-down in the enclosure for assembly.  Be aware of this before you start wiring.
